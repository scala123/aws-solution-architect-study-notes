# AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Tutorial

## Introduction to AWS EC2

**What is EC2?**
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud. It allows users to run virtual servers, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

## Getting Started with EC2

### EC2 Basics

- Learn about instances, which are virtual servers in EC2.
- Understand EC2 pricing options (On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances).
- Explore the AWS Management Console for EC2.

### Launching an EC2 Instance

- **Choosing an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**: Select the right AMI for your instance based on OS, architecture, and pre-installed software.
- **Selecting the Instance Type**: Understand different instance types and their use cases based on CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
- **Configuring Instance Details**: Set up network, IAM role, monitoring, and shutdown behavior.

### Security and Network Configuration

- **Security Groups**: Create and configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.
- **Key Pairs**: Use key pairs for secure SSH access to your instances.

## Advanced EC2 Topics

### EC2 Storage Options

- Understand the differences between instance store volumes and EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes.
- Learn how to attach, detach, and manage EBS volumes.

### Elastic IPs and Load Balancing

- **Elastic IPs**: Allocate and associate an Elastic IP (EIP) to make your instance accessible from the internet.
- **Load Balancers**: Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances.

### Auto Scaling and High Availability

- Set up Auto Scaling to maintain application availability and scale your EC2 instances automatically according to conditions you define.
- Understand the importance of placement groups and Elastic IP addresses for high availability and fault tolerance.

### Monitoring and Management

- Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your instances' performance.
- Learn about AWS Systems Manager for centralized management of your EC2 instances.

## Hands-On Exercises

- **Exercise 1**: Launch and configure an EC2 instance with a web server.
- **Exercise 2**: Attach an additional EBS volume to your instance and move some data to it.
- **Exercise 3**: Create an Auto Scaling group and test scaling policies.

## Reviewing EC2 Best Practices

- Optimize costs by choosing the right instance type and purchasing options.
- Secure your instances by configuring security groups and using key pairs properly.
- Regularly back up your EBS volumes and use multiple Availability Zones for high availability.

## Conclusion

- Highlight the flexibility and control EC2 offers for cloud computing.
- Stress the importance of security and cost optimization in your EC2 environment.
- Encourage further exploration of EC2 features and integrations with other AWS services.
