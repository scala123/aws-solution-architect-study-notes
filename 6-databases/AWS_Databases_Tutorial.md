- Explore database engines available in RDS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB.

### Amazon DynamoDB

- Understand DynamoDB as a NoSQL database service for any scale.
- Dive into creating tables, storing, and retrieving data.

### Amazon ElastiCache

- Explore using ElastiCache to improve the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches.
- Differentiate between caching strategies and scenarios for Redis and Memcached.

### Amazon Neptune

- Get to know Neptune, a fast, reliable graph database built for the cloud.
- Learn about graph models, Gremlin, and SPARQL queries.

### Amazon Aurora
