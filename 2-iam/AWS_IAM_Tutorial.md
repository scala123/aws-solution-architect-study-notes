# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Tutorial

## Introduction to AWS IAM

**What is IAM?**
IAM stands for Identity and Access Management, a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. It allows you to create and manage AWS users, groups, roles, and permissions.

## Getting Started with IAM

### Understanding IAM Users and Groups

- **Users**: IAM users represent individuals or services that interact with AWS. Learn how to create, manage, and secure IAM users.
- **Groups**: A way to categorize users to manage permissions easily. Understand how to create groups and assign users to them.

### Mastering IAM Policies

- **Policies Overview**: Policies are documents that define permissions and can be attached to users, groups, roles, or resources.
- **Writing Policies**: Learn the JSON policy language to specify who has what permissions. Understand the elements of a policy: effect, action, resource, and condition.

### Utilizing IAM Roles for Delegation and Federation

- **Roles vs. Users**: Understand when and why to use roles instead of direct user permissions.
- **Creating and Managing Roles**: Steps to create roles for various scenarios, including cross-account access and granting permissions to AWS services.
- **Identity Federation**: Learn how to allow users authenticated by your organization or a third-party service to use AWS resources temporarily.

## Advanced IAM Topics

### Best Practices for Security and Management

- Implement the Principle of Least Privilege.
- Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
- Regularly audit permissions with IAM Access Advisor and Credential Reports.

### IAM Conditions and Policy Variables

- Dive deep into IAM condition keys and variables to refine your policies for granular control.

### Understanding Resource-Based Policies

- Learn the difference between IAM policies and resource-based policies, and when to use each.

### Service Control Policies (SCPs)

- For organizations using AWS Organizations, understand how SCPs can manage permissions across the organization.

## Hands-On Exercises

- **Exercise 1**: Create an IAM user, attach a policy granting read-only access to S3, and test the configuration.
- **Exercise 2**: Set up a cross-account role with S3 access and demonstrate accessing S3 from a different account.
- **Exercise 3**: Implement a role for an EC2 instance to access DynamoDB without storing access keys on the instance.

## Reviewing IAM Features and Tools

- **IAM Access Analyzer**: Discover how to use Access Analyzer to identify shared resources and refine policies.
- **AWS Security Token Service (STS)**: Understand the use of STS for creating and providing trusted users with temporary credentials.
- **Auditing Tools**: Learn about IAM Credential Reports and the Last Used Information feature for auditing IAM users and roles.

## Conclusion

- Reinforce the importance of IAM in AWS security.
- Encourage regular review and refinement of IAM configurations.
- Suggest further reading: AWS documentation, whitepapers, and AWS re:Invent videos on IAM.
